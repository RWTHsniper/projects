# Monte-Carlo Simulation for Multiple Assets
This is a MC simulation program which incorporate general type of stochastic-differential equations (SDE). Drifts and volatility terms are expressed in terms of the power of state variables. For that reason, it is possible to simulate various types of stochastic models if one know how to construct a SDE.

# Usage
- Compilation
  - go to "build" directory and run "cmake .." and "make"
- Run
  - The input files are located in "input" directory. 
  - To run the code using "BSM.inp", in the "build" directory, type "./MultiAsset ../input/BSM.inp"
  - The output is saved in "output" directory. The values of state variables throughout the simulations will be saved. For example, "x0.csv" contains the result of 0-th state variable at each time step. Each row represents a path, and each column shows values at a time step.
- Input file
  - The input directoy is "input"
  - The string after '#' on each line is commented.
- Example (correlated Black-Scholes Model)
  - An example of two correlated Black-Scholes model with a constraint is given
  - Declaration of drift term consists of (index of LHS state variable, coefficient for a drift, index of RHS state variable, the power of RHS)
  - drift 0,-0.105,0,0 # Equivalent to dx[0] += -0.105 * x[0]^0 * dt = -0.105 * dt
  - drift 1,-0.20125,1,0 # Equivalent to dx[1] += -0.20125 * x[1]^0 * dt = -0.20125 * dt
  - Volatility terms in a SDE are defined in the same way. 
  - volatility 0,0.1,0,0 # Equivalent to dx[0] += 0.1 * x[0]^0 * dW[0] = 0.1 * dW[0] 
  - volatility 1,0.05,1,0 # Equivalent to dx[1] += 0.05 * x[1]^0 * dW[1] = 0.05 * dW[1] 
  - x0 0.0 0.01 # This specifies the two initial values for the state variables. x[0] = 0.0; x[1] = 0.01
  - T 1 # The maturity is 1-year
  - Nt 365 # The number of annual time steps
  - num_paths 10000 # The number of paths for a MC simulation
  - correlation 0,1,0.75 # Constant correlation between state variables and means corr(x[0],x[1]) = 0.75
  - constraint min,1,0.0 # x[1] > 0.0; Applying a constraint is useful for non-negative variables like stochastic volatilities
