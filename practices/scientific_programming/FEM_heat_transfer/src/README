DESCRIPTION OF THE CODE
****************************************************************************************************
* This code solves the 2d transient heat diffusion equation using the finite element method.
* It can only support 2D linear triangular elements.
* Numerical integration is done by 7 point Gauss quadrature integration.
* For the time discretization, forward Euler discretization, which is an explicit method, is used. 
* Mass matrix is lumped so that the resulting equation system can be solved without assembling the
  global equation system.
* Supports Drichlet and Neumann type boundary conditions.
* VTK library is used for post processing of the results.
